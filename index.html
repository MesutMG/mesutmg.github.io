<h1>Wiki paragrapgh</h1>

<p>A wiki is a form of online hypertext publication that is
collaboratively edited and managed by its own audience directly
through a web browser. A typical wiki contains multiple pages
for the subjects or scope of the project, and could be eitheropen to the public or
limited to use within an organization for maintaining its internal
knowledge base. Wikis are enabled by wiki software, otherwise known as wiki engines.
A wiki engine, being a form of a content management system, differs
rom other web-based systems such as blog software or static site generators,
in that the content is created without any defined owner or leader,
nd wikis have little inherent structure, allowing structure to emerge according
to the needs of the users. Wiki engines usually allow content to
e written using a simplified markup language and sometimes edited with the help
of a rich-text editor. There are dozens of different wiki engines
in use, both standalone and part of other software, such as bug tracking systems.
Some wiki engines are free and open-source, whereas others are
proprietary. Some permit control over different functions (levels of access); for example,
diting rights may permit changing, adding, or removing material
Others may permit access without enforcing access control.</p>
